# Cloud Functions for Mystic the Get-together

Before deploying these functions, make sure to edit `../.firebaserc` to target your Firebase project. You will also need to ensure that you are on the Blaze (pay as you go) plan and then enable the necessary APIs (the `firebase` tool should let you know if anything is awry).

You can deploy these functions by running `firebase deploy --only functions`
